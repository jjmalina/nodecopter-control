ALL THE STUFF THAT WE SHOULD DO
-------------------------------
- figure out whether we can leave dronestream as a separate module
    - seems like it has to be part of the project because websuckets ;_;
- Incoming websocket data is kinda hacky because it's either stringified json or binary.
- Need to be able to handle multiple keys at a time
- Do not allow any controls to be issued unless the drone is flying
  otherwise only takeoff can be called
- Fix the javascript for loop fuckery in controls.js
- HUD display design
    - Camera view
    - Altitude
    - GPS location?
    - Speed
    - Battery
    - Velocity
    - FLAT UI AND LOTS OF GRAPHS MAKE IT PRETTY
- Buttons for controls
